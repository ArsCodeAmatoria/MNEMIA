```

### 2. Configuration

Edit `configs/sophia_config.yaml` to customize:
- Model architecture and training parameters
- Data sources and composition weights
- Consciousness integration settings
- MNEMIA service connections

### 3. Data Collection

```bash
# Start collecting philosophical and scientific texts
python scripts/collect_data.py

# Monitor progress
tail -f logs/data_collection.log
```

### 4. Training

```bash
# Begin foundation training
python scripts/train.py --config configs/sophia_config.yaml

# Monitor with Weights & Biases
wandb login
# Training metrics will be tracked automatically
```

### 5. Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t sophia-llm .

# Run with MNEMIA
docker-compose up sophia-service
```
